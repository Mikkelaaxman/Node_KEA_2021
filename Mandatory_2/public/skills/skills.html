        <p>
            I've been programming on and off since 2013 and working as a woodworker in between because I love to build things in real life too.
            I constructed my first custom desktop gamer PC when i was 14, and have had fun helping family and friends build theirs as well. 
            My favourite part is probably planning and improving a build, whether it's a program, pc or a drywall, and seeing it all coming together as i planned in the end. 
        </p>
            <p>There will be added more to my Portfolio as i continue working on it and improving the website, both front and
                backend, so stay tuned! </p>
